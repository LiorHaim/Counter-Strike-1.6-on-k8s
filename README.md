# Games Robots Beer

This take you back to the begining of 2000 when i spent some time playing counter strike 1.6.

Today i have setup the server and also added CSGO then used docker version of the server and deploy them into kubernetes.

## Docker version
For counter strike 1.6 Is from "LINK here" then i added some more stuff to fit kubernetes here is the repo "LINK"

Counter strike go i have not played before but used the docker image from "LINK"



## Webpage 
To close it all down is setup a small webbpage for it as well. gmaes.robots.beer and use a nice template to get thet best feeling.
